# Discord Bot

An easy-to-use discord bot template written in `golang` using [`discordgo`](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).  
 This template was written for learning golang.  
It will be updated according to my progress in the language. 

## Features

For now the bot only have:
- `ping` command
- `author` command
- `github` command
- `ready, message` events
